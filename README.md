# hw17-fitness-tracker


# description:


Project 17 tasked the student with building out the MVC parameters for a fitness workout logger that takes in new exercises and uses MongoDB with Mongoose to log them to the database which can then be analyzed in the app's dashboard that has multiple graphic views of the different workouts. Completion of this app included the buidling out of the exercise model for the Mongo DB formatting to ensure the correct logging of the various fields in the application. As there are two different types of workouts avaialble, resistance and cardio, the requried fields for each of them will be the same while there are a few fields that are only specific to the type of workout being logged.

There wern't too many difficult parts of this project and the more labor intensive parts included setting up the server, routing for API and HTML, and the model for the database.
